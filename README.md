## Installation Guide

### Via Unity Package
By loading this repository with the Package Manager in Unity, all necessary components to run the RUDE Logger will automatically be installed. Check out the [Unity Installation Guide](https://github.com/vmasc-capabilities-lab/RUDE/wiki/Installation-Guide#unity-install) for detailed information.

### Via Import DLLs
Unfortunately at this time, RUDE use is not supported outside of Unity. Future plans to let the base C# logger class be used with any version of .Net are coming in future plans. Please check out the Future Development section for more info.
